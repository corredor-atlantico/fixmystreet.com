This directory contains shapefiles & layer definition files
for the WFS service provided by MapServer deployed as part
of the tilma vhost.

Files in this directory are not directly accessible from
Apache - you need to add the appropriate line to the tilma
httpd.conf file in order for new .map files to be picked
up by MapServer.
